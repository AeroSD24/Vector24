Vector24 (VTR24) is a simple vector drawing tool made in python and overlays over the roblox minimap without violating TOS. It lets you click and drag to get the heading of an aircraft and draw an "ILS Approach" overlaying the map. This makes vectoring more easier now on ATC24 so you no longer have to guess your headings or where the approach is!

Key Features:

    Interactive Vector Drawing: Click and drag to draw vectors, with heading (angle) displayed dynamically.
    Position Selection: You can select you controlling position so people can see where you are controlling
    Discord Rich Presence Integration: Automatically updates your Discord status to reflect drawing activity.

Vector24 is a convenient and engaging tool for quick vector visualization, with added social integration through Discord.
